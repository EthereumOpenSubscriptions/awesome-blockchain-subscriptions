# Awesome Blockchain Subscriptions [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

*A curated collection of links for blockchain subscriptions and recurring payments.*

Subscriptions, or any kind of recurring payments, aren't trivial to build on a blockchain. The underlying mechanisms only allows payers to move money from their account and no one else. Despite that, there are plenty of projects and hackers who are actively trying to go around these limitations.

The list is periodically updated with new links. Click "Watch" in the right top corner to follow. Your contributions are welcomed. Add links [by yourself](contributing.md).
